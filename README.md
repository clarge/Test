~~Crossed Out Example~~

Here is some `inline-code` for you!
And below, we have our **BLOCK!** (java highlighting)
```java
if (this_is_code){
	execute();
}
else{
	do_nothing();
}
```

Now, here is an example of a tasklist:

- [x] This is done done.
- [ ] This is not done.

And finally, a table!

Header 1 | Header 2

Cell 1 here!|Cell 2!
Column 1 biz| Column 2 stuff!
